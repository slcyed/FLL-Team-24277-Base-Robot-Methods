# WARNING!
Please do not make any edits in any of the existing files! Almost certainly editing them will not do
what you think it does.
This includes
- base_robot.py
- spike.py
- spike/control.py
- spike/operator.py

Those files are only here to help write programs in VS Code. Editing them will not change how your 
programs run. They provide intellisense hints and that is it. If they are not present, when you are 
writing code the code completion and the intellisense popups will not work. VS Code will also think 
you have coding errors in your program, when in fact you may not. In other words, just leave those 
files alone.

base_robot.py
-------------
base_robot.py is a special file. This is the BaseRobot class. It contains functions and properties 
of FLL Team 24277's Base Robot.

This file must be uploaded to the hub in order for it to work. Use ampy
https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-basics-load-files-and-run-code/install-ampy
To upload the file, use a command like this

    C:\>ampy -p COM6 put "C:\Users\Me\Documents\LEGO Education SPIKE\TestProj\base_robot.py" /base_robot.py

# Instructions
You will write your programs to move the robot and to do things. VS Code will give you hints 
along the way and will help you to make sure spelling is correct. Yes, spelling matters!!

First, make a folder where you want to keep your files. May I suggest something in your 
Documents folder, such as

Documents/FLL_Fall_2022

In there you will make your program(s), which you can call just about anything, such as
main.py
mission1.py
MissionImpossible.py
AnythingYouWant.py
etc. You get the picture. You can have as many of those as you want. Don't forget to put the 
other files in there as mentioned above. And all of the files, including the ones you write,
must end with ".py" (not including this instructions file)

Your folder should look like this

Documents/FLL_Fall_2022
├── spike.py *
├── spike *
│   ├── control.py *
│   └── operator.py *
├── base_robot.py *
├── instructions.txt * (this file)
├── main.py @@
├── Mission1.py @@
├── AnyOtherProgramsYouWrite.py @@

Do not edit or delete any of the files with asterisks!
You will create and edit the files with the @@ marks.

Begin your programs with these lines:

import base_robot
import sys
from spike.control import wait_for_seconds, wait_until, Timer
from spike.operator import greater_than, greater_than_or_equal_to, \
   less_than, less_than_or_equal_to, equal_to, not_equal_to

br = base_robot.BaseRobot()



In python, indenting also matters. Unless you are writing loops or using if/then 
statements, all of your code MUST start in the first column of each line. Also,
you can use the line continuation "\" like that import line above, in which case
the indenting doesn't matter for the continued lines.

When you are writing your code, remember, to python, your robot's name 
is "br" (see that line up above that starts with br =? That's where your robot 
got its name). Try typing "br." (without the quotation marks) and see what hints 
VS Code gives you. Also try "br.driveMotors.". There you will see your familiar 
"move_tank" and other ways to move the robot. You can also use some of the special 
programs that your teammates have written such as GyroDrive. As you write more 
code, you will see all the ways that VS Code tries to help you.

VS Code configuration
Install the extension LEGO SPIKE Prime / MINDSTORM Robot Inventor Extension
Connect your hub to your computer (either BlueTooth or USB)
Open the SPIKE app on your computer and connect to the hub. Install any updates 
that are required.
Back in VS Code, in the lower left corner, click on "LEGO Hub: Disconnected" 
to get it to connect. At the top of the screen, you will see options for ports.
It can be difficult to figure out which port to use, so you may have to try them 
all.
